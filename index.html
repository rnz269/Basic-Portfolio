			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img class="profile" src="assets/images/profile1.jpg" alt="My profile picture"/>
			<p>
			My name is Rahul Nallappa and I am a senior at Northwestern pursuing degrees in math and economics. In my free time, I enjoy watching sports, exercising, reading, playing guitar, and playing board games. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Like many who are raised near Chicago, I've cultivated a strong passion for our sports teams. Specifically, the Cubs. As a child, I dreamed about leading the Cubs to a long sought after World Series Championship. While that dream faded as I grew older, I nevertheless followed the team with a religious obsession. As such, this past fall was very special for me, and I was able to watch the deciding Game 7 from the bleachers in Cleveland alongside with my older brother. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Over the past years, I have realized a passion for understanding the inner workings of the web, which has led me into the field of computer programming. I hope to leverage this passion, along with my desire sto innovate, into a product or service that will better the world. Although, if I have learned one thing from watching HBO's Silicon Valley, the tech industry as a whole is  committed to "making the world a better place." I hope they mean it as much as I do.
